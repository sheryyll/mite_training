/*1. Election Vote Count (Using Arrays)
"Problem Statement:"  
A city conducts an election with "5 candidates". Citizens cast their votes (numbers "1 to 5" representing candidates). 
Write a program to:  
1. Read"`N" votes into an array.  
2. Count the total votes for each candidate.  
3. Determine the "winner" (candidate with the highest votes).  

"Function Prototypes":
    void countVotes(int votes[], int n, int candidateVotes[]);
    int findWinner(int candidateVotes[]);

Sample Test Case:  
Input:  
Enter number of votes: 10  
Enter votes (1-5): 1 2 2 3 1 4 2 5 1 1 
Output:  
Candidate 1: 4 votes  
Candidate 2: 3 votes  
Candidate 3: 1 vote  
Candidate 4: 1 vote  
Candidate 5: 1 vote  
Winner: Candidate 1
