1.  Reverse an array in-place with O(1) space complexity

2.  Find the duplicate elements in an array

3.  Find the second largest number of a given unsorted array with only one pass

4.  Find the missing number in an array of size N containing numbers from 1 to N+1 without using hashmaps

5.  Reverse a string without using built-in string functions

6.  Write a function to check if the array is sorted

7.  Find the largest repeating element of an array

8.  Print frequency of each element in an array

9.  Find the first repeating element of an array

10.  Swap two numbers without using a third variable

11.  Count the number of times a character repeats in a string

12.  Compress the given string “aaabcddeeee” into a2bcd2e4

13.  Given an integer array move all zeros to the end

14.  Write a program to print all the
  LEADERS in the array. An element is a leader if it is greater than all the
  elements to its right side. The rightmost element is always a leader.

15.  Given a string containing just the
  characters (, ), {, }, [ and ], determine if the input string is valid. Open
  brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets in the correct order.

16.  Given an array of integers, modify the
  array such that all even numbers appear at the beginning and all odd numbers
  appear at the end. The order of numbers does not matter.

17.  Given two arrays, arr1 and arr2,
  check whether arr2 is a subset of arr1
  (i.e., all elements of arr2 are present in arr1)

18.  Given an array nums, return an array where each element is
the product of all elements except itself. Do it without using division and in
O(n) time.
# Input: [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [24,12,8,6]

19.    Find all unique triplets in the array that sum to zero.
# Input: [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
# Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]

20.  Given an m x n matrix, return all elements in spiral order.
# Input: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
# Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]

21.  Group all anagrams together in an array
of words
Input
- {“eat”, “ant”, “tan”, “ate”, “tea”)
Output
– {“eat”, “ate”, “tea”, “ant”, “tan”}
